1. Ease to develop for developers.
Python: Python is more ease than D3 because its easy grammar.
Tableau: Tableau is the most ease because it don't require	coding ability.
D3: D3 requires background knowledge of HTML,CSS and javascript thus is not ease.

2. Ease to maintain the visualization for developers.
Python: Not ease as Tableau, maybe need to import some other libraries.
Tableau: Tableau is ease for changing, just need to change some parameter.
D3: When requirement changes D3 need to change its code to fulfill requirement so it's not ease.

3. Usability of visualization developed for end users.
Python: Python's visualization is limited to the library.
Tableau: Tableau is able to create interactive chart which make it easy for end users to find what they want.
D3: D3 also could create interactive chart and could be designed as whatever users want.

4. Scalability of visualization to “large” datasets.
Python: Python is good at analyzing big data not large datasets.
Tableau: Able to handle large datasets, depends on how much data you request.
D3: D3 cannot process large datasets, it needs some pre-processing.

5. System requirements to run the visualization.
Python: Python is compatible for many systems.
Tableau: Tableau is highly compatible which uses desktop, server and online mode.
D3: D3's needs newer version of the browser.
